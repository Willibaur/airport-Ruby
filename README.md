Airport Challenge
=================

This is my first solo project for the first weekend Challenge on Makers Academy.

This project is about a system to control the flow of planes.

I was requested to apply all technologies learned until now, TDD, BDD, SRP, RsPec,
Ruby and some other tools.

Is a public repo and can be found on:
